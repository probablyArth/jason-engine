# jason-engine

A full fledged database engine over json files.

## Project Status - [SPIKE](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)>)

I have no idea how I am going to do this, but here we go.
I have basic knowledge of how databases work internally and constantly learning as I go.
Here is a simple(or complex (?)) implementation in typescript.

## Why?

I created a basic type-safe ORM library for json files (here's a [link](https://github.com/probablyarth/jason) to that), last year and published it to npm.
However there were many more things I could add, and I have been getting more and more curious about how databases work every since I discussed it with one of my mentors and how can I make one for myself.

## Planned features

_features marked with (?) are optional and will be figured out as we go_

- Transactions
- ACID principles
- Indexes
- Authentication and Authorization (?)
- sharding (?)
