## Schemas

- users can create schemas, they have a list of types they can pass in the type property.
- the default id field for storing uid should be \_id, it cannot be overwritten.
- params for createdAt and updatedAt.
- constraints?

# File System and storage

- allow table wise customization for row-based storage or column-based storage (?)
