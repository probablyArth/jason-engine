- figuring out how to store schemas
- make your own schema constructor??
- think about event driven pattern and various events
- Debouncing is cool, but what if the program crashes in between. how do we restore the saved data which wasn't actually stored?
- Maybe we should not debounce for metadata, since there will be not that much amount of writes in that?
